# InterviewCodingPractice

This project contains coding interview practice taken from various sources,
written in Python.

The project is the following topics:

- Arrays (of integers) under file `array.py`
- Strings under `string.py`
- Data Structures under `structures.py`
- Sorting Algorithms under `sorting.py`

## Running Project

Each question/algorithm can be run from `main.py`.

## General Notes:

Additional comments about _time_ and _space_ complexity were added to
each question/algorithm.

Python Library usage was reduced to minimal in order to make solutions as
language agnostic as possible.
